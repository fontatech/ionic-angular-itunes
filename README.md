IONIC + Angular excercise

Ionic sample ITUNES list app using Angular standalone components to improve app performance instead of NgModules

Bootstrapped via ionic cli and then modified to add the functionality (API response parsing, HttpClient injection, views personalization)

Ionic native components have been used most of the time



Useful commands

ionic serve: check and debug on browser

ionic cap copy: keep both ios and android builds up to date

ionic cap open android: open android studio if configured and runs the project

ionic cap open ios: opens xcode if configured and runs the project
